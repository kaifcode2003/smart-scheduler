## Overview

**Smart Scheduler** is a command-line task management system written in C++ that uses data structures and algorithms to prioritize and manage tasks. It demonstrates practical usage of:
- Min Heaps (via `priority_queue`)
- Hash Maps (`unordered_map`)
- Classes and OOP
- STL and custom comparators


---

## Features

-  Add a new task (with title, description, deadline, and priority)
-  View the top-priority task
-  View all existing tasks
-  Complete the top-priority task
-  Delete any task by ID
-  Auto-prioritize using a **Min-Heap** based on priority value

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- Terminal / Command prompt

### Compile & Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp task.cpp task_manager.cpp -o scheduler
./scheduler
